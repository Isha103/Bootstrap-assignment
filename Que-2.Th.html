<!-- What is a Bootstrap Container?

A Bootstrap container is a fundamental layout element that wraps content and provides proper alignment, padding, and responsiveness. It ensures that the content is structured and adapts well to different screen sizes.

Types of Bootstrap Containers

Bootstrap provides three types of containers:

1. .container (Fixed-Width Container)

This container has a responsive fixed width, meaning its maximum width changes at different breakpoints.

It is centered on the page.

Example:

<div class="container">
  <h1>Fixed Container</h1>
</div>



2. .container-fluid (Full-Width Container)

This container stretches the full width of the viewport.

It adapts dynamically to different screen sizes without fixed max widths.

Example:

<div class="container-fluid">
  <h1>Full-Width Container</h1>
</div>



3. .container-{breakpoint} (Responsive Container)

This container starts as container-fluid (full width) and becomes fixed at a specific breakpoint.

Example:

<div class="container-md">
  <h1>Responsive Container</h1>
</div>

Available breakpoints:

container-sm (≥576px)

container-md (≥768px)

container-lg (≥992px)

container-xl (≥1200px)

container-xxl (≥1400px)





How Does It Work?

The container class applies padding and margins to the content, ensuring proper spacing.

Inside the container, Bootstrap’s grid system can be used to align elements.

The fixed container has max-width values set for different screen sizes, while the fluid container adapts dynamically.
